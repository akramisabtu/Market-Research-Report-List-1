<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Mapping Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Cardiac mapping systems</li><li>Non-contact Cardiac mapping systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cardiac mapping market is divided into two main types: contact cardiac mapping systems and non-contact cardiac mapping systems. </p><p>Contact cardiac mapping systems involve the use of catheter-based devices that directly touch the heart tissue to gather data on electrical activity. This method provides high-resolution mapping but may involve invasive procedures. </p><p>In contrast, non-contact cardiac mapping systems utilize external sensors to create a map of the heart's electrical field from a distance, allowing for less invasive procedures and improved patient safety.</p></p>
